    <h1> Isabel de Luis </h1>
    <p> I’m a first-year graduate student at MIT AeroAstro, researching with 
        Prof. Julie Shah’s Interactive Robotics Group and Dr. Ben Armstrong 
        at the Industrial Performance Center. I received my Bachelor’s of 
        Science in Engineering from Olin College of Engineering in May 2025.
        My research is in human-computer interaction, driven by a commitment 
        to improving the safety and transparency of intelligent systems. 
        I’ve previously worked on projects at Caltech, MIT, and JPL exploring 
        human factors and autonomy in aviation and space exploration.</p>
